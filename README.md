# Daily-Scheduler

## Description

I was tasked with my 5th challenge to make a daily scheduler.

- Learned to work with jQuery 
- Learning more how to edit pre made code.
- Problem solved issues.
- Added extra hours for a more "daily" use rather than "work day use"

I followed the criteria below provided by the class instructors.

## User Story

- AS AN employee with a busy schedule
- I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
- SO THAT I can manage my time effectively


## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
- WHEN I open the planner
- THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- WHEN I scroll down
- THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm
- WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
- THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- WHEN I click into a time block
- THEN I can enter an event
- WHEN I click the save button for that time block
- THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
- WHEN I refresh the page
-  THEN the saved events persist
